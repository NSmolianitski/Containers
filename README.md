# Containers
"Containers" is a School 21 project that aims to reimplement and learn more about original C++ STL containers.
All containers below contain all C++98 methods (except the allocator).

### List of implemented containers
- vector
- list
- map
- queue
- stack

### Comments
The queue and stack contain the deque in STL by default, but I decided to use a list in queue and a vector in stack (cause I had no task to reimplement deque).

The allocator and it's functions are omitted for the same reason.

This project also contains main file with some tests for these containers. This got me thinking about some standardized testing in the future projects.

### What I learned
- the principle and functionality of STL containers
- some things about templates and metaprogramming
- a lot of new about Iterators and about C++ in general (since it was my first big project in this language)

## Attention ‚ùó
This project is not perfect. I assume most of the bugs can be found in iterators.
