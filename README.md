# Containers
"Containers" is a School 21 project that aims to reimplement and learn more about original C++ STL containers.
All containers below contain all C++98 methods (except the allocator)

### List of implemented containers
- vector
- list
- map
- queue
- stack

### Comments
The queue and stack contain the deque in STL by default, but I decided to use a list in queue and a vector in stack (cause I had no task to reimplement deque).

The allocator and it's functions are omitted for the same reason.

## Attention ‚ùó
This project is not perfect. I assume most of the bugs can be found in iterators.
